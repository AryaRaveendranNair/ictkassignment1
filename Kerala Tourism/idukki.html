                at an elevation of 1200 m, Vagamon (also spelt Wagamon) is one of the most
                sought-after destinations in Idukki.
                Vagamon is known for its scenic hillocks, locally known as ‘Motta Kunnu’, and
                majestic pine forests spread over hundreds of acres.Vagamon is one of the few places where you can do Tandem Paragliding
                in Kerala. Witnessing the grandeur of the Western Ghats from the skies
                is an unequalled experience altogether. </p>

              <p class="card-text">Considered one of the best treks in Kerala, Meesapulimala is a Shangri-la for
                hikers. The peak bears a resemblance to a tiger and its whisker and hence the
                name Meesapulimala, derived from the local language. Resting at an altitude of
                2,640 m, Meesapulimala is one of the highest peaks in Kerala. The trail is much like a Rousseau
                painting coming to life. Chase the wild butterflies to the abyss, stroll along with
                the myriad rhododendron trees, toss your worries into the isle of clouds. </p>

                <p class="card-text">Located in the legendary South Western Ghats of India, it got its name due to
                    its standing at the confluence of three rivers – Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni and
                    Kundala Rivers.Some of the most
                    loved sites here include Eravikulam National Park, Anamudi Peak, Mattupetty,
                    Top Station and the Tea Museum. The Queen of the Hills is not a moniker that is given out lightly, but
                    Munnar claimed it seamlessly like a pureblood monarch. This hill destination is today atop every global traveller's bucket list, standing as the ultimate
                    culmination of natural beauty being gently shaped into an international
                    tourist hotbed. The hills, meadows and plantations stretch out in all directions, and the moment your car begins the upward climb to its dreamy
                    peaks, the realization that you are mere miles away from the very doorway
                    to Paradise becomes rather clear.

                    <p class="card-text">The grandest and most-visited site in all of Munnar, Eravikulam National Park
                        is home to some of the most mystical species in all of Kerala, be it the majestic
                        Nilgiri Tahr or the blue gem that blooms only once every 12 years, the Neelakurinji (Strobilanthes kunthianus). Spread out over an area of 97 sq. km, it is
                        located Devikulam Taluk of Idukki district.The National Park is a protected area and is divided into three regions - the core
                        area, the buffer area and the tourism area. Visitors are allowed only to the tourism area that is in Rajamala, the region lying beyond the road entry into Eravikulam. Eravikulam is also famous for being the natural habitat of the endangered
                        Nilgiri Tahr, the endangered mountain goat and this park was built with the aim
                        of protecting and conserving them.

                        <p class="card-text">Legend has it that the mythical heroes Pandavas along with their wife Panchali
                            took shelter here at Panchalimedu during their exile. And hence the name
                            Panchalimedu; medu meaning hill. Panchalimedu is more of a soft hiking spot
                            rather than a trekking trail. It’s the perfect place to take a day off with your
                            family. Panchalimedu is one of the best modelled differently-abled friendly
                            destinations in Kerala.Beliefs co-exist with harmony here. You can find a series of crosses on
                            one side and a Hindu temple on another. During the hike, you can also
                            see the Panchalikulam and Pandava Guha. During the festive occasion of
                            Makar Sankranthi, thousands of devotees converge here to witness the
                            Makara Jyothi.
