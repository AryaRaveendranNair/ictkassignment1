              <p class="card-text">Dr. Salim Ali, the renowned ornithologist from
                Kerala, discovered Thattekkad and
                considered it to be the richest bird habitat in the
                peninsula.With its evergreen forests, Thattekkad is noted
                for indigenous birds like Malabar Grey Hornbills,
                many types of woodpeckers, and rose-ringed and
                blue-ringed parakeets. Named after Dr. Ali, the
                bird sanctuary here is home to diverse species,
                especially during the migratory season. Rare
                birds like Ceylon Frogmouths and Rose-billed
                Rollers are also spotted here.   </p>

                by many historical influences, the traces of which can still
                be found in its very streets. Portuguese, Dutch and British
                influences are evident in the Indo-European architecture
                of the buildings dotting this town.A prime example of this is Fort Immanuel, a Portuguese
                bastion built in 1503 to mark the strategic alliance
                between the Maharaja of Cochin and the Portuguese
                monarch. </p>

                from Kochi city. It is surrounded by the
                backwaters and now emerging as a
                tourist hotspot, owing to its rural tourism
                activities.
                The mangrove forests here provide a
                good breeding ground for prawns, crabs,
                oysters and small fishes. This island
                village is dotted with Chinese fishing nets,
                and boasts of a rich aquatic life.</p>

                    Situated in the high ranges on the southern
                    bank of the Periyar River, it nurtures
                    elephants that are abandoned or hurt, and
                    trains them later.Elephants specially trained for safari are
                    fitted with saddles. Visitors can spend time
                    here in the company of elephants, and also

                        among the distributaries of the Periyar River. Situated about 8 km
                        from the city, this region is an emerging tourist destination. Though
                        technically within the urban limits, it is tucked safely away from the
                        cityâ€™s clamour, which makes this island group a perfect place to relax
                        and unwind.
                        Water transport boats, private boats and tourist boats frequently
                        ply in this route. Kadamakkudy is easily accessible as it is linked to
                        Varappuzha town by National Highway 66.

                            the oldest active synagogue among the
                            Commonwealth nations. Constructed in 1568,
                            this synagogue was destroyed in a shelling
                            during the Portuguese raid in 1662 and
                            rebuilt two years later by the Dutch.
                            The Paradesi Synagogue is notable for its
                            mid-eighteenth century hand-painted, willowpatterned floor tiles, Hebrew inscriptions
