              <p class="card-text">Thenmala  is the first planned
                eco-tourism destination in India. The
                lush green terrain of Thenmala, dotted
                with forests and rubber plantations, was
                selected by the World Tourism Organisation
                as one of the best eco-friendly tourism projects.
                 It spreads over ten eco-tourism spots that cover the hill ranges of Thiruvananthapuram,
                  Pathanamthitta and Kollam districts.Trekking, boating, tenting, bird watching, mountain biking, rock climbing, rappelling
                  and river crossing are some of the activities in store for adventure enthusiasts. Apart
                  from these, Thenmala also has a leisure zone with winding pathways, a sway bridge, a
                  sculpture garden, a boardwalk, a culture zone with an amphitheatre, and a musical
                  fountain.  </p>

                Chadayamangalam, Kollam that
                features a stunningly colossal statue
                of Jatayu. Popular belief has it that the
                vulture-king mentioned in the epic
                Ramayana fell on this rocky hill when Ravana
                sliced off its wing during an aerial combat as
                Jatayu tried to prevent the abduction of Sita. Considered the world’s largest bird sculpture, it has a rock theme park and an adventure centre for sports enthusiasts. The 60 ft.
                tall, 150 ft. broad and 200 ft. long figure of the fallen bird stands as a symbol of valour
                and sacrifice. The Jatayu Earth’s Center offers a bird’s eye view from 1000 ft. above sea
                level.</p>

                is situated amidst a dense patch
                of tropical forest in Kollam. As its
                name suggests, the waterfall resembles
                a milky stream gushing down a rocky
                terrain. The stream traces its course through
                a range of medicinal plants and herbs in the
                forest that are known to have therapeutic properties. The site of the waterfall serves as a
                perfect picnic spot with the surrounding lush green forest. It offers a view of the pictorial
                hazy blue mountains, and provides a chance for a refreshing dip in the waters</p>

                    the only wildlife sanctuary in
                    Kollam, is part of the Agasthyamala
                    Biosphere Reserve. The sanctuary owes
                    its name to the endemic plant species,
                    Gluta travancorica, locally known as
                    Cherukurinji. Situated on the southern part
                    of the Western Ghats, this sanctuary is set amidst luxurious greenery, and is acclaimed
                    for its rich biodiversity. The terrain is mostly covered by tropical evergreen and semievergreen forests. The endangered Lion-tailed Macaque can be seen in these
                    forests. The rare Great Eared Nightjar has also been spotted here. Idimuzhanganpara,
                    Pallivasal, Rockwood, Kurunthottivalavu, and Lake View and Kalamkunnu are the five
                    camping sites in the sanctuary.

                        India, which is also called the London Bridge of Kerala. The picturesque Kallada River in
                        Punalur also draws many visitors. As Punalur is a stopover for Sabarimala pilgrims, the
                        Department of Tourism has constructed a bathing ghat on the shores of the Kallada to
                        provide food and accommodation facilities to the pilgrims. Punalur is located near the
                        eastern border of Kollam district
                        and the banks of the Kallada River. It
                        is also the largest hill city in India

                            ‘gold village,’ was once a flourishing trade centre. Vestiges of many
                            old European influences can still be
                            seen in many parts of the area. This seaside town was called ‘Dutch Quilon’ by the
                            British. It is a historically significant location
                            that now shelters the remnants of an old Portuguese fort and churches. The famed
                            lighthouse here, which was built in 1902, stands 144 ft. high. The top of the lighthouse
                            offers a breathtaking view of the entire town and the adjacent sea.
